##It demonstrates the interactive classification for a patient traige system application

Objective Research #1: Have the ability to classify a patient based on the visibility of a real-world environment.

Scenarion Use case: In a undermanned, filled medical environment, how can we have the most visibility on a patients status in order to morally and ethically classify them in a HL7/ START method traige standard. Based on our current limitation with telemetry, are we able to leverage a wearable to provide realtime, quantifiable data to our EHR for traige.
